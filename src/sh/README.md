# Git Repo Structure for Python

1. `my_repository/`: The root directory of your Git repository.
2. `project1/`, `project2/`, `project3/`: Directories for each individual project within the repository.
3. `app/`: Directories for the source code of each project.
4. `tests/`: Directories for test files corresponding to each project.
5. `docs/`: Directories for documentation files, such as user manuals or API references, specific to each project.
6. `requirements.txt`: A file containing the dependencies and packages required for each project. It's recommended to have a separate file for each project to manage dependencies independently.
7. `README.md`: A file containing information about the repository as a whole, including a brief introduction, instructions on how to get started, and any other relevant information.

* This structure allows you to keep each project isolated and organized within its own directory.
* It also provides separate locations for code, tests, and documentation, making it easier to navigate and maintain the repository.
* Each project can have its own set of requirements, allowing for independent version management.

Remember that this structure is a starting point, and you can adapt it to fit your specific needs or preferences.

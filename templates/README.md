# Boilerplate Dockerfile

In the boilerplate Dockerfile, you'll need to replace the following placeholders with your actual values:

<base_image>: The base image for your Docker container, such as ubuntu:latest or node:14.
<command_to_install_dependencies>: The command to install any dependencies your application requires, such as npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt. If your application doesn't have any dependencies, you can omit this line.
<port_number>: The port number that your application listens on. Specify the port number your application expects traffic on, like 80 for a web server.
<key>=<value>: Any environment variables your application needs. Replace <key> with the environment variable name and <value> with the corresponding value.
<command_to_run>: The command to start your application. For example, python app.py or npm start. This command will be executed when the container is launched.
